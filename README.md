# Curta Golf
[**Website**](https://curta.wtf?tab=golf) - [**Docs**](https://curta.wtf/docs/golf/overview) - [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/curta_ctf)

A king-of-the-hill style competition, where players optimize gas challenges.

The goal of players is to view [**Courses**](https://github.com/waterfall-mkt/curta-golf-courses) (challenges) and try to implement the most optimized solution for it. If the solution is valid, a **Par Token** with the corresponding metadata will be minted to their address. If it's the most efficient, they will be crowned the "King," and **King** NFT will be transferred to them.
